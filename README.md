# How to install (CASIO fx-9x50)
To install the game in an original CASIO fx-9x50, you'll need a cable to connect the computer to the calculator.
Once you have one, download CASIO FA-124 from https://edu.casio.com/education/support_software/dl/PC_links/fa124_inst_204_2.zip.
This program will allow you to upload files to the calculator.
Install it, and when it's done, open the program and connect your calculator to the computer. If it's via USB, a window will pop up on the calculator. Press [F1] to select recieve and transmit memory.
After that, go to FA-124 and click on the "Connect" icon from the Calculator window. This will connect the computer to the calculator.
Grab CASDUNG.G1M to FA-124 -> Default.
Once it is on the "Default" folder, expand it and move the already imported file to the "Program" folder from the calculator. Then, remove the cable.
Now you can play on your calculator! Just press MENU > 9, select RPG V2.0 and press EXE to play.
Have fun!
